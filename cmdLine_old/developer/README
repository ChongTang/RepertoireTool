1. Run the script ./process_diff_dev.py input_diff.c
 
To extract developer's information corresponding to each changed line, this script extracts the original source file line number from the original diff and stores it in a .csv file in the following format:
   diff_line | source_line | file_name
==========================================================================
2. conv_annotate.py: parses an annotate file FOO and create a directory FOO which contains .csv files corresponding to each source file mentioned in FOO.
The .csv files are in the form:
source_line_number,"source code",developer,commit_date,file_version

==========================================================================
3. dev.py : maps each diff line with corresponding author.
  
  If foo.csv is output of step 1, dev.py takes foo.csv as its input and 
  maps diff_line to author with the information found in step 2.

  The output is stored in DEV_DIR

==========================================================================
4. calDev.py: calculate percentage and entropy of developers involved in ported changes.
   "Usage: calDev.py input.txt directory"
   "input.txt is the output of REPERTOIRE, i.e., converted output from ccFinder"
	"directory is the DEV_DIR from step 3"
